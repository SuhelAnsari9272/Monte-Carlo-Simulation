# Monte Carlo Simulation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the versatility and power of Monte Carlo simulations by solving five distinct problems. The aim is to showcase various applications of Monte Carlo methods in estimating probabilities, solving integrals, and more. The project includes Python implementations for each problem, highlighting my data science skills and expertise.

## Problems Solved
1. **Monty Hall Problem**:
   - **Objective**: To determine the best strategy for the Monty Hall game show problem using Monte Carlo simulations.
   - **Approach**: Simulated numerous games to compare the probabilities of winning by switching versus staying with the initial choice.
   - **Results**: Validated that switching doors increases the probability of winning to approximately 66.67%.

2. **Solving an Integral**:
   - **Objective**: To estimate the value of a given integral using Monte Carlo integration.
   - **Approach**: Implemented a Monte Carlo method to approximate the area under the curve for a single-variable function.
   - **Results**: Achieved a close approximation of the integral's value, demonstrating the efficiency of Monte Carlo methods for numerical integration.

3. **Double Integral**:
   - **Objective**: To compute the value of a double integral using Monte Carlo simulation.
   - **Approach**: Extended the Monte Carlo integration technique to handle double integrals, providing an estimate for the area under a surface.
   - **Results**: Successfully approximated the double integral, showcasing the scalability of Monte Carlo methods.

4. **Collecting All Toys from Chip Packets**:
   - **Objective**: To estimate the average number of chip packets needed to collect all 15 different toys.
   - **Approach**: Simulated the process of buying chip packets until all toys were collected, averaging the results over many simulations.
   - **Results**: Determined the average number of packets required, highlighting the practical application of Monte Carlo methods in everyday scenarios.

5. **Tic-Tac-Toe Winning Probability**:
   - **Objective**: To estimate the probabilities of different outcomes in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
   - **Approach**: Simulated 100,000 games to determine the probabilities of Player X winning, Player O winning, and the game ending in a draw.
   - **Results**: Found that Player X has a higher probability of winning, while draws are extremely rare in random play.
